# Electrical components
# 1.ARDUINO
# Let's learn a bit about the ARDUINO


Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the Arduino language, originated from the Processing language. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.

# 2.SERVO MOTOR
# Let's learn a bit about the servo motor

A servo motor is a DC motor integrated with a gear train, a shaft encoder, and some control logic so that it is easier to use. They have a limited rotation, typically 180Â°.A servo motor has a 3-pin interface with power (typically 5 V), ground, and a control input. The control input is typically a 50 Hz pulse-width modulated signal. The servo's control logic drives the shaft to a position determined by the duty cycle of the control input. The servo's shaft encoder is typically a rotary potentiometer that produces a voltage dependent on the shaft position.

Below is the Image of how servo motor looks like!!
