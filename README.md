# Electrical components
# 1.ARDUINO
# Let's learn a bit about the ARDUINO


Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the Arduino language, originated from the Processing language. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.

# 2.SERVO MOTOR
# Let's learn a bit about the servo motor

A servo motor is a DC motor integrated with a gear train, a shaft encoder, and some control logic so that it is easier to use. They have a limited rotation, typically 180°.A servo motor has a 3-pin interface with power (typically 5 V), ground, and a control input. The control input is typically a 50 Hz pulse-width modulated signal. The servo's control logic drives the shaft to a position determined by the duty cycle of the control input. The servo's shaft encoder is typically a rotary potentiometer that produces a voltage dependent on the shaft position.

Below is the Image of how servo motor looks like!!

# Let's learn a bit about the servo motor

LM35 is a precession Integrated circuit Temperature sensor, whose output voltage varies, based on the temperature around it. It is a small and cheap IC which can be used to measure temperature anywhere between -55°C to 150°C. It can easily be interfaced with any Microcontroller that has ADC function or any development platform like Arduino.

# 4.LED
# Let's learn a bit about the LED

LED, in full light-emitting diode, in electronics, a semiconductor device that emits infrared or visible light when charged with an electric current. Visible LEDs are used in many electronic devices as indicator lamps, in automobiles as rear-window and brake lights, and on billboards and signs as alphanumeric displays or even full-colour posters. Infrared LEDs are employed in autofocus cameras and television remote controls and also as light sources in fibre-optic telecommunication systems.
By varying the precise composition of the semiconductor, the wavelength (and therefore the colour) of the emitted light can be changed. LED emission is generally in the visible part of the spectrum (i.e., with wavelengths from 0.4 to 0.7 micrometre) or in the near infrared (with wavelengths between 0.7 and 2.0 micrometres). The brightness of the light observed from an LED depends on the power emitted by the LED and on the relative sensitivity of the eye at the emitted wavelength.

# 5.RESISTOR
# Let's learn a bit about the RESISTOR

The resistor is a passive electrical component that creates resistance in the flow of electric current. In almost all electrical networks and electronic circuits they can be found. The resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). An ohm is the resistance that occurs when a current of one ampere (A) passes through a resistor with a one volt (V) drop across its terminals. The current is proportional to the voltage across the terminal ends.

Resistors are used for many purposes. A few examples include limiting electric current, voltage division, heat generation, matching and loading circuits, gain control, and setting time constants. They are commercially available with resistance values over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude. They can be used as electric brakes to dissipate kinetic energy from trains, or be smaller than a square millimeter for electronics.

# 6.POTENTIOMETER
# Let's learn a bit about the Potentiometer

A potentiometer is a manually adjustable variable resistor with 3 terminals. Two of the terminals are connected to the opposite ends of a resistive element, and the third terminal connects to a sliding contact, called a wiper, moving over the resistive element. The potentiometer essentially functions as a variable resistance divider. The resistive element can be seen as two resistors in series (the total potentiometer resistance), where the wiper position determines the resistance ratio of the first resistor to the second resistor. If a reference voltage is applied across the end terminals, the position of the wiper determines the output voltage of the potentiometer.

# 7.ULTRASONIC SENSOR
# Let's learn a bit about the Ultrasonic sensor

The ultrasonic sensor (or transducer) works on the same principles as a radar system. An ultrasonic sensor can convert electrical energy into acoustic waves and vice versa. The acoustic wave signal is an ultrasonic wave traveling at a frequency above 18kHz. The famous HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor generates ultrasonic waves at 40kHz frequency.

Typically, a microcontroller is used for communication with an ultrasonic sensor. To begin measuring the distance, the microcontroller sends a trigger signal to the ultrasonic sensor. The duty cycle of this trigger signal is 10µS for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. 
Ultrasonic sensors can detect objects placed within their range, but they cannot distinguish between different shapes and sizes. However, one can overcome this limitation can by using two sensors instead of just one sensor. One can install both sensors a distance away from each other, or they can be adjacent. By observing the overlapped shaded region, one can get a better idea of the shape and size of the target object.

# 8.IR SENSOR
# Let's learn a bit about the IR sensor

An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. These types of sensors measure only infrared radiation, rather than emitting it that is called a passive IR sensor. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation.
The working principle of an infrared sensor is similar to the object detection sensor. This sensor includes an IR LED & an IR Photodiode, so by combining these two can be formed as a photo-coupler otherwise optocoupler. The physics laws used in this sensor are planks radiation, Stephan Boltzmann & weins displacement.
