# 1.ARDUINO
## Let's learn a bit about the ARDUINO


Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the Arduino language, originated from the Processing language. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.

# 2.SERVO MOTOR
## Let's learn a bit about the servo motor

A servo motor is a DC motor integrated with a gear train, a shaft encoder, and some control logic so that it is easier to use. They have a limited rotation, typically 180°.A servo motor has a 3-pin interface with power (typically 5 V), ground, and a control input. The control input is typically a 50 Hz pulse-width modulated signal. The servo's control logic drives the shaft to a position determined by the duty cycle of the control input. The servo's shaft encoder is typically a rotary potentiometer that produces a voltage dependent on the shaft position.

Below is the Image of how servo motor looks like!!

# 4.LED
## Let's learn a bit about the LED

LED, in full light-emitting diode, in electronics, a semiconductor device that emits infrared or visible light when charged with an electric current. Visible LEDs are used in many electronic devices as indicator lamps, in automobiles as rear-window and brake lights, and on billboards and signs as alphanumeric displays or even full-colour posters. Infrared LEDs are employed in autofocus cameras and television remote controls and also as light sources in fibre-optic telecommunication systems.
By varying the precise composition of the semiconductor, the wavelength (and therefore the colour) of the emitted light can be changed. LED emission is generally in the visible part of the spectrum (i.e., with wavelengths from 0.4 to 0.7 micrometre) or in the near infrared (with wavelengths between 0.7 and 2.0 micrometres). The brightness of the light observed from an LED depends on the power emitted by the LED and on the relative sensitivity of the eye at the emitted wavelength.

# 5.RESISTOR
## Let's learn a bit about the RESISTOR

The resistor is a passive electrical component that creates resistance in the flow of electric current. In almost all electrical networks and electronic circuits they can be found. The resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). An ohm is the resistance that occurs when a current of one ampere (A) passes through a resistor with a one volt (V) drop across its terminals. The current is proportional to the voltage across the terminal ends.

Resistors are used for many purposes. A few examples include limiting electric current, voltage division, heat generation, matching and loading circuits, gain control, and setting time constants. They are commercially available with resistance values over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude. They can be used as electric brakes to dissipate kinetic energy from trains, or be smaller than a square millimeter for electronics.

# 6.POTENTIOMETER
## Let's learn a bit about the Potentiometer

A potentiometer is a manually adjustable variable resistor with 3 terminals. Two of the terminals are connected to the opposite ends of a resistive element, and the third terminal connects to a sliding contact, called a wiper, moving over the resistive element. The potentiometer essentially functions as a variable resistance divider. The resistive element can be seen as two resistors in series (the total potentiometer resistance), where the wiper position determines the resistance ratio of the first resistor to the second resistor. If a reference voltage is applied across the end terminals, the position of the wiper determines the output voltage of the potentiometer.

# 7.ULTRASONIC SENSOR
## Let's learn a bit about the Ultrasonic sensor

The ultrasonic sensor (or transducer) works on the same principles as a radar system. An ultrasonic sensor can convert electrical energy into acoustic waves and vice versa. The acoustic wave signal is an ultrasonic wave traveling at a frequency above 18kHz. The famous HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor generates ultrasonic waves at 40kHz frequency.

Typically, a microcontroller is used for communication with an ultrasonic sensor. To begin measuring the distance, the microcontroller sends a trigger signal to the ultrasonic sensor. The duty cycle of this trigger signal is 10µS for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. 
Ultrasonic sensors can detect objects placed within their range, but they cannot distinguish between different shapes and sizes. However, one can overcome this limitation can by using two sensors instead of just one sensor. One can install both sensors a distance away from each other, or they can be adjacent. By observing the overlapped shaded region, one can get a better idea of the shape and size of the target object.

# 8.IR SENSOR
## Let's learn a bit about the IR sensor

An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. These types of sensors measure only infrared radiation, rather than emitting it that is called a passive IR sensor. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation.
The working principle of an infrared sensor is similar to the object detection sensor. This sensor includes an IR LED & an IR Photodiode, so by combining these two can be formed as a photo-coupler otherwise optocoupler. The physics laws used in this sensor are planks radiation, Stephan Boltzmann & weins displacement.

# 9. ANALOG JOYSTICK
## Let's learn a bit about the ANALOG JOYSTICK

The Analog Joystick is similar to two potentiometers connected together, one for the vertical movement (Y-axis) and other for the horizontal movement (X-axis). The joystick also comes with a Select switch. It can be very handy for retro gaming, robot control or RC cars.The analog joystick has a handle and two slotted shafts around the handle (along the x-axis and y-axis). The handle can be pushed to any point in a plane, which will cause one or both of the slotted shafts to pivot. Each slotted shaft is attached to a potentiometer on the side, which converts the angular displacement of the shaft to an analog signal.
The data for each axis is determined in analog using a potentiometer, communicating position in the form of voltage. This is possible because the shaft is connected to a wiper and resistive strip inside the potentiometer.

# 10. FORCE SENSOR
## Let's learn a bit about the Force Sensor

A Force Sensor is a sensor that helps in measuring the amount of force applied to an object. By observing the amount of change in the resistance values of force-sensing resistors, the applied force can be calculated.
The general working principle of Force Sensors is that they respond to the applied force and convert the value into a measurable quantity. There are various types of Force Sensors available in the market based on various sensing elements. Most of the Force Sensors are designed using Force-Sensing Resistors. These sensors consist of a sensing film and electrodes.

The working principle of a Force-sensing resistor is based on the property of ‘Contact Resistance’. Force-sensing resistors contain a conductive polymer film that changes its resistance in a predictable manner when force is applied on its surface. This film consists of, sub-micrometres sized, electrically conducting and non-conducting particles arranged in a matrix. When force is applied to the surface of this film, the microsized particle touches the sensor electrodes, changing the resistance of the film. The amount of change caused to the resistance values gives the measure of the amount of force applied.

# 11. FLEX SENSOR
## Let's learn a bit about the Flex Sensor

A flex sensor is a kind of sensor which is used to measure the amount of defection otherwise bending. The designing of this sensor can be done by using materials like plastic and carbon. The carbon surface is arranged on a plastic strip as this strip is turned aside then the sensor’s resistance will be changed. Thus, it is also named a bend sensor. As its varying resistance can be directly proportional to the quantity of turn thus it can also be employed like a goniometer.
The pin configuration of the flex sensor is shown below. It is a two-terminal device, and the terminals are like p1 & p2. This sensor doesn’t contain any polarized terminal such as diode otherwise capacitor, which means there is no positive & negative terminal. The required voltage of this sensor to activate the sensor ranges from 3.3V -5V DC which can be gained from any type of interfacing.

#### Pin P1: This pin is generally connected to the +ve terminal of the power source.
#### Pin P2: This pin is generally connected to GND pin of the power source.

# 12. MOTOR WITH ENCODER
## Let's learn a bit about the Motor With Encoder

An encoder motor is a type of motor in which a rotary encoder is mounted to its backside that provides feedback to the system by tracking the speed or the position of the motor shaft.In any rotary encoder there are two outputs, labeled A and B or they can be something similar depending upon the product. But the underlying concept stays pretty similar, for the sake of simplicity, we can imagine a rotary encoder as like two switches inside the encoder, which is made common with VCC or GND (Depends on the manufacturer), now when it rotates the common terminal touches the A terminal or the B terminal, the terminal is so placed that if the encoder is rotating clockwise, contact A will go high, next contact B will go High, this means that depending upon the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), there will always be a 90-degree phase shift. And we can simply detect this phase shift with the help of a microcontroller to determine the direction of the rotation and once we do that, we can increment or decrement a counter which tells us the RPM or the degree of rotation (in case of a geared encoder motor). The image below will give you a better idea of the process.

# 13. L293D DUAL H-BRIDGE MOTOR DRIVER
## Let's learn a bit about the L293D dual H-bridge motor driver

L293D Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver IC DIP-16 Package is quadruple high-current half-H driver.The L293 is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 1 A at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V. The L293D is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600-mA at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V. Both devices are designed to drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, dc and bipolar stepping motors, as well as other high-current/high-voltage loads in positive-supply applications. All inputs are TTL compatible. Each output is a complete totem-pole drive circuit, with a Darlington transistor sink and a pseudo Darlington source. Drivers are enabled in pairs, with drivers 1 and 2 enabled by 1, 2 EN and drivers 3 and 4 enabled by 3, 4 EN. When an enable input is high, the associated drivers are enabled, and their outputs are active and in phase with their inputs. When the enable input is low, those drivers are disabled, and their outputs are off and in the high-impedance state.With the proper data inputs, each pair of drivers forms a full – H (or bridge) reversible drive suitable for solenoid or motor applications.
