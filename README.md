# Let's learn a bit about the servo motor

A servo motor is a DC motor integrated with a gear train, a shaft encoder, and some control logic so that it is easier to use. They have a limited rotation, typically 180Â°.A servo motor has a 3-pin interface with power (typically 5 V), ground, and a control input. The control input is typically a 50 Hz pulse-width modulated signal. The servo's control logic drives the shaft to a position determined by the duty cycle of the control input. The servo's shaft encoder is typically a rotary potentiometer that produces a voltage dependent on the shaft position.
